- Log in to your Cloudflare account.
- Navigate to the R2 section from the dashboard.
- Click on Create Bucket.
- Assign a unique name to the bucket (e.g., ebooks-storage) and configure the options as needed.
  
### 2.Upload E-books to the Bucket

- Once the bucket is created, access it from the R2 panel.
- Use the Upload option to add your e-book files (.pdf, .epub, etc.) to the bucket.
- Ensure files are either publicly accessible or protected, according to your preference.

### 3. Obtain the File URLs

- After uploading, copy the public URL provided for each file.
- Use these links to serve the e-books on your website or distribute them.
